# Recommendation_system
This Recommendation system was completely developed by me (Eng.Rawan Khaled Mohamed) 
We designed a system that uses Natural language processing and computer vision techniques to classify opinions expressed through text, records, images and finally videos. then we implemented the system that uses the models
that perform the classification tasks. The system is more like a chatbot that asks you about the digit data that you will input as an oipnion and start classifying it then output the type of sentimnet within that data.
We also added a facility that the system, can save the number of recommendations for products based on positive sentimnets and the unrecommended based on the negative sentiments, then the user can just ask to show the list containg the recommended products
that got the highest recommendations and lowest unrecommended.
